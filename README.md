🛒 E-commerce Sales Dashboard – Power BI Case Study
📊 Project Overview:
This Power BI dashboard provides a deep dive into an e-commerce company’s sales performance across products, regions, and sales teams. The aim is to track growth trends, identify top-performing products and salespeople, and guide strategic decisions to boost profitability.

📈 Key Metrics:
Total Sales: $26M
Total Profit: $8M
Profit Margin: 32.52%
Data Range: 2018 – 2021

🔍 Analysis & Insights:
1. 📅 Sales Trends Over Time
Steady increase in sales observed from 2018 to 2021.
Peak months show recurring spikes—likely tied to promotional periods (e.g., July, November).
Seasonal sales strategy should be optimized around these high-performing months.

2. 🧑‍💼 Top Salespeople
Highest profit contributions from:
Kenneth Bradley
Ryan Welch
Bobby Russell
Top 5 salespeople contribute nearly 30% of total profits, suggesting a need to replicate their approach across the team.

3. 🛍️ Top-Selling Products
Best-selling products:
Product 63: $0.63M
Product 28: $0.60M
Product 47: $0.56M
These products can be promoted further or bundled with slower-moving inventory.

4. 🌍 Regional Performance
Counties like Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino dominate in profit.
Tailored marketing and inventory allocation in these regions can drive further growth.

💡 Recommendations:
📦 Focus on top 10 products: Expand ads and inventory for best-performers.
🌎 Geo-target marketing: Prioritize high-profit counties for regional campaigns.
🧑‍💼 Sales team optimization: Analyze top sellers’ techniques and build training models.
📊 Month-over-month tracking: Use seasonality to inform marketing and stock planning.
